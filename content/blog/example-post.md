# How to Optimize Your CV for ATS Systems

Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) are used by 75% of companies to filter resumes before they reach human recruiters. Here's how to optimize your CV to pass these systems.

## Use Standard Formatting

Avoid complex layouts, tables, and graphics. Stick to clean, simple formatting with clear section headers.

## Include Relevant Keywords

Match keywords from the job description naturally in your experience and skills sections.

## Use Standard Section Headings

Use conventional headings like "Work Experience," "Education," and "Skills" rather than creative alternatives.

With Cvenom, your CV is automatically optimized for ATS systems while maintaining professional appeal.
